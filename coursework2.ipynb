    "#### Question 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias correction terms in the Adam algorithm are useful during the initial iterations of the algorithm. We initialise both first and second moments to 0 and update them as $\\text{moment} = \\beta \\cdot \\text{moment} + (1- \\beta){new \\, moment}$ for $\\beta$ < 1, usually = 0.9 to 0.99. We can see that in the initial stages, the effect of the first few incoming moments are being scaled down by the $(1- \\beta)$ factor. Therefore the bias correction term divides the moments by a factor $(1- \\beta^t)$ to mitigate this and help the algorithm move quicker in the initial stages. As the number of iterations $t$ grows, the bias correction factor converges to 1, thereby becoming insignificant as the algorithm settles."

    "\n",
    "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is an extension of gradient descent, designed to reduce computational cost when training dataset size is too large for GPU or system memory. It achieves this by approximating the gradient of the loss function with smaller minibatches. This reduces the number of gradient calculations required per iterative descent step and the size of these minibatches is selected such that they fit within the memory requirements of the system."

    "#### Question 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of Kaiming initializtion is to initialise the weights such that input signals are not exponentially magnified or reduced as they are propagated through the network layers. This can be mathematically stated as $Var(y_L) = Var(y_1)$, meaning the variance of the last layer is the same as variance of the first for a newly initialised network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case we can look at forward propagation for a feed forward Relu network. Let $y_l = W_lx_l$ for the equation of the $l$'th indexed layer with no bias. $y_l$ is composed of $n_l$ multiplications $w_lx_l$ for row vector $w_l$ and column vector $x_l$. Assume elements of $y_l$, $w_l$ and $x_l$ are independent and distributed symmetrically around 0.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Var(y_l) = n_l \\, Var(w_lx_l) = n_l \\, \\mathbb{E}[w_l^2]\\mathbb{E}[x_l^2] = n_l \\, Var(w_l)\\mathbb{E}[x_l^2]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can use the Relu activation to rewrite $x_l$ in terms of $y_{l-1}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[x_l^2] = \\mathbb{E}[Relu(y_{l-1})^2] = \\mathbb{E}[(y_{l-1} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}(y_{l-1} > 0))^2] = \\mathbb{E}[y_{l-1}^2 \\cdot \\mathbb{1}(y_{l-1} > 0)] = \\frac{1}{2} \\mathbb{E}[y_{l-1}^2] = \\frac{1}{2} Var(y_{l-1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we can substitute this back into the variance equation and expand it from layer 1 to L:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Var(y_l) = \\frac{1}{2} n_l \\, Var(w_l) \\, Var(y_{l-1}) \\implies Var(y_L) = \\left( \\prod_{l=2}^{L} \\frac{1}{2} n_l \\, Var(w_l) \\right) \\, Var(y_{1})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now returning to our original goal, if we want $Var(y_L) = Var(y_1)$, requiring $\\frac{1}{2} n_l \\, Var(w_l) = 1 \\quad \\forall l > 0$ is sufficient. If we let $w_l$ follow a gaussian distribution and $Var(w_l) = \\frac{2}{n_l}$, then $w_l \\sim N(0, \\frac{2}{n_l})$ fulfils this requirement and $\\sigma_l = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_l}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the $\\sqrt{2}$ factor can be traced back to taking the second moment under Relu from layer to layer. The $\\frac{1}{2}$ factor comes out of the fact that $Relu(x)$ is zero for $x < 0$ and all initialization elements are symmetrically distributed around 0."

    "In the plot $a$, the training loss steadily decreases. Starting at just under 0.7, the first 200 epochs loss falls faster than the last 300 but both are relatively slow. After 500 epochs the loss is still relatively high at just above 0.1 and the algorithm evidently has more training left to do. The loss curve is veery smooth with no spikes or oscillations. These factors indicate the learning rate is too small and parameter updates are too conservative, resulting in slow model convergence. To improve this convergence, we would increase the learning rate and let the model take larger parameter update steps as this would help the loss fall faster.\n",

The first 80 epochs show potential convergence but then the loss rises and never meaningfully converges. From epoch 100 onwards, the base loss is around 0.3 with frequent spikes to almost 0.6. This behaviour is indicative of a learning rate that is too high. We can clearly see the model constantly overshoot itself in the loss landscape and jump around without converging smoothly to the minimum. To improve this convergence we would decrease the learning rate so that the model converges more carefully. We might also increase batch size if we can as this would result in less noisy parameter updates.\n",

For the remaining 450 epochs, the loss slowly and consistently decreases with occasional small oscillations. By the end of 500 epochs the model seems to have converged at a near zero loss which is exactly as desired. The model convergence was stable and efficient compared to the other two plots, indicative of a well chosen learning rate. This convergence is already quite good and there is nothing obvious we might to do improve it. Out of the box suggestions might include using a scheduler to scale down learning rate over a number of epochs. We could also use momentum for perhaps even faster and better convergence."

    "2. normalise transform applies channel-wise normalisation for each pixel. It computes $x_{norm} = \\frac{x-0.5}{0.5}$. This transforms the pixel ranges from [0, 1] to [-1, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Converting to pytorch tensors is needed so that we can carry out pytorch operations e.g. feed through models etc. Scaling and normalising the pixel values to be centred around zero is useful so that all numbers are in a small controlled range and avoid exploding or vanishing values/gradients during training which leads to more efficient convergence."

    "\n",
    "- This is not a surprising result as we reduced the complexity of the task my removing 3 of 5 categories, reducing the problem to only a binary classification. This makes it inherently easier for the model to distinguish between the two remaining classes due to simpler decision boundaries. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The original model's fully connected layers were tasked with identifying 5 different classes. By adding more 'post-processing' parameters in the form of the MLP to classify from extracted features, thereby giving the model more capacity to learn and resulting in high accuracies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is evident that the CNN on its own struggled to generalise well on its more challenging dataset. The greatly improved accuracies with the fine tuning indicate that the feed forward layers of the CNN were inadequate for the scale of the original task. On the other hand, the feature extraction layers of the CNN were useful in the fine tuning and show that they learnt well.\n",

    "- The CNN started at a high loss and steadily decreased over the epochs, showing some variability with occasional increases and decreases. This reflects the complexity of it's original task and show how the feed forward layers int the original model were struggling. In contrast, the loss for the fine tuned MLP drops rapidly to near 0, indicating that the binary classification problem was learned very quickly, meaning a larger feed forward classifier was easily able to capture the differences between only two classes.\n",

    "#### Explain the role of the parameter epsilon in the function and how the algorithm is working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Epsilon ($\\epsilon$) is the 'size of the perturbation'. Intuitively it defines a search space around x, the maximum allowed change under the $L_\\infty$ norm, in which to find an adversarial example. The idea is that within this small $\\epsilon$-radius of our starting image, we can find a similar adversarial image which gives us a different output from the classifier and this adversarial example is at most '$\\epsilon$ far' from the original image. Higher epsilons have higher success rates in finding an adversarial example but at the cost of imperceptibility (i.e. the adverse example will be more different to the original).\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by initialising the following variables. $\\alpha = \\frac{\\epsilon}{T}$, where T is the number of iterations, is set as a step size such that even if we travel in the same direction T times, we are at most $\\epsilon$ from the starting image and ensuring we stay within the $\\epsilon-L_\\infty$ ball. $g_0=0$ initialises our momentum variable to 0. And $x^*_0=x$ begins our search for the adversarial image at the original image.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm loops for $0 \\leq t \\leq T-1$:\n",
    "- In each iteration it classifies the current image $x^*_t$ and computes the gradient of the loss function (in our case NLLLoss) with respect to $x^*_t$.\n",
    "- This gradient ($grad$) is then used to update the momentum variable as follows: $g_{t+1} = \\mu \\cdot g_t + \\frac{grad}{\\| grad \\|_1}$. The previous momentum is multiplied by a decay variable $\\mu$ and the newest normalised gradient is added. The decay variable determines how strongly the momentum rememberes gradients from far in the past. By building this momentum, the algorithm can better navigate the loss landscape, i.e. noisy or oscillating gradients, in search of the adversarial example.\n",
    "- Then the sign of the momentum $g_{t+1}$ is used to update the current image as follows: $x^*_{t+1} = x^*_t + \\alpha \\cdot \\text{sign}(g_{t+1})$. The effect of the momentum can be understood with a simple example, e.g. if there is lots of initial momentum in the positive direction and then a small amount in the negative direction, we can see how the momentum would likely still have positive sign.

    "The trend is that the success rate of finding an adversarial image grows with $\\epsilon$. From $\\epsilon=0.02$ to $0.06$, there is quite a sharp increase from 25% to 72%, after which it plateaus to 84% at $\\epsilon=0.1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This outcome is expected. As explained in the description of the algorithm, $\\epsilon$ defines the $L_\\infty$ ball around the original image (pixel-wise) in which we can search for an adversarial example. Higher epsilon will naturally result in higher success rate due to the fact we have a wider search radius and we can stray further from the original in search of an image that the classifier thinks is different. However, if we compared successful examples at $\\epsilon=1$ and $\\epsilon=0.05$ to the original, the $\\epsilon=0.05$ example would likely be more similar and be considered a better adversarial example as it was able to fool the classifier with less changes to the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rapid increase at smaller epsilons indicate that the model is robust at these small epsilons but quickly becomes vulnerable to attack as epsilon grows. The plateauing curve shows diminishing returns past $\\epsilon=0.1$."

    "#### Comment on the impact of adversarial attacks in real-world applications and discuss possible ways to mitigate them. (Machine learning researchers are usually required to include a broader impact statement in their papers about potential consequences of their work, which is why I’m including this question)\n",
    "\n",
    "Adversarial attacks can have an impact anywhere that machine learning models are deployed in the real world, especially in security and privacy sentitive settings. E.g.: \n",
    "- Autonomous vehicles may not decide to brake at the sight due to the mis-classification of a human or obstacle on the road in the object detection software.\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis software used to scan MRIs and X-rays. A segmentation model can fail to identify a tumor or hairline fracture in an image and thereby resulting in a critital mis-diagnosis of the patient.\n",
    "- Biometric authentication systems must be absolutely robust to small perturbations in input fingerprint/facial scan so as to not allow for unauthorised access.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the above examples could have widespread and detremental impact if the adversarial attacks are not properly accounted for in the deployment of these ml models. Therefore it is essential that these developers investivate the robustness of their models.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of mitigating these adversarial attacks: E.g.:\n",
    "- Training/tuning models on adversarially collected images. This method allows the model to learn from its mistakes and define better decision boundaries between classes, becoming more robust against small perturbations in its input. This method might take time and effort to collect enough examples and then fine tune the model.\n",
    "- Training with augmentation e.g. cropping, resizing, adding small amounts of noise, random colour scale adjustments. Used in the appropriate setting for images, e.g. our example above would have worked, augmentations work as a regularisation and makes the model more robust to small insignificant changes that it might have otherwise been fooled by. This method has close to no additional cost at training time and none at evaluation time. \n",
    "- Ensemble models. This method runs multiple trained versions of the model, usually in parallel, and combines them to create an output. E.g. out of 5 models, 4 classify the image as class 3 and 1 classifies as class 2, the overall vote would lean in favour of class 4. We can easily see how this would make it harder for adversarial examples to fool more than one model. You could also use ensemble models to run confidence checks and evaluating statistical significance of outcomes. However this comes at a large cost of not only storing but also running computation on all of these unique models.\n",
    "- Monte-carlo dropout. Models can be designed with dropout layers. Inference on the input can be run multiple times, each time giving the dropout layers a chance to regularise the model differently. We can therefore use this one model in the same way as the ensemble models described previously."
